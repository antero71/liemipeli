 Updated:   01.06.96
 
 Java class to calculate the phase of the moon, given a date. The
 'moonPhase' method is a Java port of some public domain C source which 
 was apparently originally part of the Decus C distribution (whatever
 that was). Details of the algorithm are given below.
 
 To use this in a program, create an object of class 'MoonCalculation'.
 
 I'm not convinced that the algorithm is entirely accurate, but I don't
 know enough to confirm whether it is or not.
 
    HISTORY
    -------
    
    31.05.96    SLAM    Converted from C
    01.06.96    SLAM    Added 'phaseName' to return the name of a phase.
                        Fixed leap year test in 'daysInMonth'.

    // MoonPhase
    //
    // Output the phase of the moon for the given year, month, day.
    // The routine calculates the year's epact (the age of the moon on Jan 1.),
    // adds this to the number of days in the year, and calculates the phase
    // of the moon for this date.
    //
    // In the algorithm:
    //
    //      diy     Is the day of the year - 1 (i.e., Jan 1 is day 0).
    //
    //      golden  Is the number of the year in the Mentonic cycle, used to
    //              determine the position of the calender moon.
    //
    //      epact   Is the age of the calender moon (in days) at the beginning
    //              of the year.  To calculate epact, two century-based
    //              corrections are applied:
    //              Gregorian:      (3 * cent)/4 - 12
    //                      is the number of years such as 1700, 1800 when
    //                      leap year was not held.
    //              Clavian:        (((8 * cent) + 5) / 25) - 5
    //                      is a correction to the Mentonic cycle of about
    //                      8 days every 2500 years.  Note that this will
    //                      overflow 16 bits in the year 409600.  Beware.
    //
    // The algorithm is accurate for the Gregorian calender only.
    //      
    // The magic numbers used in the phase calculation are as follows:
    //       29.5           The moon's period in days.
    //      177             29.5 scaled by 6
    //       22             (29.5 / 8) scaled by 6 (this gets the phase)
    //       11             ((29.5 / 8) / 2) scaled by 6
    //
    // Theoretically, this should yield a number in the range 0 .. 7.  However,
    // two days per year, things don't work out too well.
    //
    // Epact is calculated by the algorithm given in Knuth vol. 1 (calculation
    // of Easter).  See also the article on Calenders in the Encyclopaedia
    // Britannica and Knuth's algorithm in CACM April 1962, page 209.

    // Arguments to the function are:
    //
    // int     year     1978 = 1978
    // int     month    Jan = 1
